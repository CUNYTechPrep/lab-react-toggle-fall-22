# React Toggle Boards Lab

## Toggle Boards Exercise

In this lab you're given starter that displays three boards with borders and a toggle button. Your task is to fill in the code that will make the next board become active (have a green border), when the toggle button is clicked. A description of the behavior is below

- Initially, the first board is active and has a green border.
- When you press the toggle button, the second board should be active, and the first one should be inactive.
- When you reach the last board, and you press the toggle button, the first one should become active again.
- For a working solution see: https://cunytechprep.github.io/lab-react-toggle-solution/

To start off and understand the desired toggle effect, try changing `let isSelected = ii === 0;` to `let isSelected = ii === 1;`
